# TypingTest
An MS-DOS inspired typing test, created with pygame


### Requierments
* Root Privlages:
    *  This is requiered because github by default adds root privlages to the repo folder, which prevents the game from saving your scores to the GameStats.txt

* Pygame:
    * The entirty of the game is intialized in the pygame module. [Instructions on instalation](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) can be found here.

* Matplotlib:
    * This game includes a graphing feature that creates a graph with data from GameStats.txt. Here is a [link to its intsaltion.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
